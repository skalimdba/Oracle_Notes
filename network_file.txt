Network configuration files:
1)listener.ora
2)tnsnames.ora
3)sqlnet.ora

Tools: netmgr,netca ---> to create listener and tns entry.

listener.ora

	1. listener is listening new incoming connection.
	2. listener is authorizing the user..listener comes in picture when user try to connect to with db.
		listener authorizing the user with the help of pmon process.
	3. listener contains following details:
		1. Host name or Host Ip
		2. Port No  ---> default port 1521
		3. ORACLE_SID
		4. ORACLE_HOME
		
	4. listener is residing in server side and used for remotely connection with db.
	5. The location of listener file is $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin.
	6. There are followoing option to control listener.
	
		- lsnrctl start listener_name           ---> To start listener
		- lsnrctl stop listener_name			---> To stop listener
		- lsnrctl status listener_name			---> To check status of  listener
		- lsnrctl reload listener_name			---> To reload listener when make any changes in listener e.g change port no, ip etc.
		
	7. In listener there are two types of registration
		1. static registration
		2. dynamic registration
		
	8. In static registration we need to mention ORACLE_SID in listener.ora file.
	9. In dynamic registration we don't need to set ORACLE_SID ..here listener registration by pmon process..
		-for these we need to set local_listener paramete by following command:
		- SQL> alter system set local_listener='(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST =192.168.100.233)(PORT = 1530)))'
		- SQL> altet system register;
		
	10. static listener status always show 'UNKNOWN' wheter db is up or not.
		and dynamic listener status show 'READY' and it's work only if db is up.
		
	11. one instance give service to multiple services..	
	12. but many instance can't service to single service.
	
	13. we can change service name in db..
	
	
tnsnames.ora

	1. This file reside in client side and the location of this file is $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin
	2. This file is used to connect db remotely.
	3. This file contains following details:
		1. Host name or Host Ip
		2. Port No
		3. ORACLE_SID or SERVICE_NAME
		
	4. Ex: sqlplus alim/alim@DR
	5. tnsping used to check connectivity with listener..
		Ex: tnsping [Alias_name]
		it will give response wheter it's reachable to listener or not.
	
	
	
sqlnet.ora

	1. This file used for security related purpose..which control the network configuration file of Oracle Net Services..
	2. like which host can access to db or which host can't access..

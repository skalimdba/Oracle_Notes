TDE:

1.  Transparent data encryption enables you to encrypt database data files or selected columns of data.
2.  Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enables you to encrypt sensitive data that you store in tables and tablespaces.
3.  It also enables you to encrypt database backups.
4.  Transparent Data Encryption can be applied to individual columns or entire tablespaces.
5.  TDE helps protect data stored on media (also called data at rest) 
    in the event that the storage media or data file is stolen.

6.  To configure Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), you must be granted either the SYSTEM administrative privilege or
    the ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT system privilege.

7.  Oracle Database uses authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to secure data in the database,
    but not in the operating system data files where data is stored. To protect these data files, Oracle Database provides
    Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). TDE encrypts sensitive data stored in data files. To prevent unauthorized decryption,
    TDE stores the encryption keys in a security module that is external to the database.

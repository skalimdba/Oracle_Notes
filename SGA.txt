SGA: 

Shared pool:  
	
	1. Data dictionary cache: contain metadata of database..like how many objects are there, no.of rows etc.
	2. Library cache: sql syntax, semantics check here..and generate plan hash value..
	
Database Buffer cache:
	
	1. It's contain actual copy of data block from data files.
	2. Data block size can be 2k,4k,8k,16k,32k.. default size 8k

	Different Buffer status:
	unused -> pinned -> used -> Dirty (afetr commit) -> clean 


Redlog Buffer Cache:

	1. It contain all the changes of database goes here..
	1. It contain SCN, Timestamp, old and new image value.

PGA:
	1. it's private 
	2. it's store bind variable(user specific)..
	3. user login information
	4. sorting 
		

Background Process:

	by the help of these BG process database communicate with OS..	
	
	1. PMON (Process Monitor): 	
		1. it's monitor user process and all other background process.
		    and if any process not working then it will try restart.

		2. Perform the process allocation and releasr resources (which taken by users).
		3. releas lock.
		
	
	2. SMON (System/Super Monitor):
		1. instance recovery when instance crash happened.
		2. free temporary tablespace.
		3. it's system level cleanup duties.
		
	3. DBWR (Database Writer)
	
		1. commited data write into datafile.
			when write:
			1. checkpoint
			2. database stop
			3. if db buffer full and new request come then dirty buffer write  into datafile.
			
			
			
	4. LGWR
		1.Every 3 sec.
		2. 1/3rd full.
		3. Checkpoint.
		4. Switch log.
		5. DB stop
		6. 1Mb redo generated.
		
	5. CKPT

		1. Update SCN between datafile and controlfile header.
		
		When
			1. Manually Checkpoint
			2. DB Stop.
			3. tablespace offline/online, backup initiated.

Server Process: It is process which work on behalf of user..

SGA: It is shared memory, shared among with all user and process..It contain following components.
Shared pool:  It contain two sub pool.
	1. Data dictionary cache: contain metadata of database..like how many objects are there, no.of rows,
	   user detail, table details, user privilege etc.
	2. Library cache: sql syntax, semantics check here..and generate plan hash value of sql query..
	
Database Buffer cache:
	
	1. It store copy of actual data block coming from data file by user queries.
	2. Data block size can be 2k,4k,8k,16k,32k.. default size 8k

	Different Buffer status:
	unused -> pinned -> used -> Dirty (afetr commit) -> clean 


Redlog Buffer Cache:

	1. It store redo entries copy. All the changes made into the db goes into redo entries.
	2. It use for instance recovery.
	1. It contain SCN, Timestamp, old and new image value.

Java Pool:
	All java procedure and code of java application running on oracle dba software.

Large Pool:
	It use at the time of Rman backup.

Stream Pool:
	use for replication purpose.

PGA:
	1. it's private..Non shared memory, dedicated to each server process to perform execution of sql satatment.
	2. it's store bind variable(user specific)..
	3. session information
	4. sorting 
		

Background Process:

	by the help of these BG process database communicate with OS..	
	
	1. PMON (Process Monitor): 	
		1. it's monitor user process and all other background process.
		    and if any process not working then it will try restart.

		2. Perform the process allocation and releasr resources (which taken by users).
		3. releas lock.
		
	
	2. SMON (System/Super Monitor):
		1. instance recovery when instance crash happened.
		2. free temporary tablespace.
		3. it's system level cleanup duties.
		
	3. DBWR (Database Writer)
	   It's writes dirty block in the buffer cache to the datafiles.
	   Event when DBWR happen:
		when write:
		1. checkpoint
		2. database stop
		3. if db buffer full and new request come then dirty buffer write  into datafile.
		
			
			
	4. LGWR
	It writing redolog buffer entries to a redo log file on disk.
	Event when LGWR happen:
		1.Every 3 sec.
		2. 1/3rd full.
		3. Checkpoint.
		4. Switch log.
		5. DB Shutdown.
		6. 1Mb redo generated.
		
	5. CKPT
	Update SCN between datafile and controlfile header.
	Event when CKPT happen:
		1. Manually Checkpoint 
		2. DB shutdown.
		3. tablespace offline/online, backup initiated.

	6. ARC:
	1. It will generate offline redolog file in specified location.
	2. This will be done only if db is archivelog mode.
`	Event when ARC happen:
		1. When swithc log. 

	MMAN(Memory Manager):
		1. This process manages the shared memory and automatic memory allocation in the db.
			dynamically adjust the size of the SGA components.

	MMON(Manageability Monitor):
		1. This process is responsible for managing & monitor the db performance, including AWR & ADDM.


NOTE:

SQL> alter system checkpoint ---> Manual checkpoint
SQL> alter system switch logfike ---> Switch logfile

SGA: 

Shared pool:  
	
	1. Data dictionary cache: metadata of database..like how many objects are there, no.of rows etc.
	2. Library cache: sql syntax, semantics check here..and generate plan hash value..
	
Database Buffer cache:
	
	1. 
	
	

Redlog Buffer Cache:

		1. It contain SCN, Timestamp, old and new image value.

PGA:
		1. it's private 
		2. it's store bind variable(user specific)..
		3. user login information
		4. sorting 
		

Background Process:

	by the help of these BG process database communicate with OS..	
	
	1. PMON (Process Monitor): 	
		1. it's monitor user process and background process..and if any non mandatory process not working then it will try to start.
		2. Perform the process allocation and release lock and resources (which taken by users).
		
	
	2. SMON (System/Super Monitor):
		1. instance recovery when instance crash happened.
		2. free temporary tablespace.
		3. it's system level cleanup duties.
		
	3. DBWR (Database Writer)
	
		1. commited data write into datafile.
			when write:
			1. checkpoint
			2. database stop
			3. if db buffer full and new request come then dirty buffer write  into datafile.
			
		unused -> pinned -> used -> Dirty (afetr commit) -> clean 	
			
	4. LGWR
		1.Every 3 sec.
		2. 1/3rd full.
		3. Checkpoint.
		4. Switch log.
		5. DB stop
		6. 1Mb redo generated.
		
	5. CKPT

		1. Update SCN between datafile and controlfile header.
		
		When
			1. Manually Checkpoint
			2. DB Stop.
			3. tablespace offline/online, backup initiated.
